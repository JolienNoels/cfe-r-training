## R Markdown

*This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.*

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Question: Does it matter what symbol we use for lists?

Answer: No.

- Item 1
- Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   + Item 3a
   + Item 3b

### Question: Is there a better way to create tables without typing out everything?

If you want a nicely rendered table from data, use `knitr::kable()`

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars))
```

If you want to create the table yourself, but don't want to type so much, use 
the _Visual RMarkdown editor_. It's at the top of this file, to the right. The 
button looks like a compass. You can then _Insert a new table_, choose the 
number of rows and columns, and fill it out by navigating using the `Tab` key.

| Room 1      | Room 2 |
|-------------|--------|
| Maria Paula | Jolien |
| Michelle    | Insung |
| Alexandra   | Marcos |
| Aline       | Lenka  |

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
