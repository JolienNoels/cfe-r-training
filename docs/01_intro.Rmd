Most of the functionality in open source languages like R and Python comes from packages or libraries.

Anyone can write and publish an R package. This means there can be many (up to hundreds of) packages to do the same thing.

Given the large variety of packages, it's important to choose packages that are of good quality (e.g. that are well-tested or actively maintained), that have a large user base, or that have a cohesive design.

As a team, it's also a good idea to have some cohesiveness on the packages used, particularly for the most common data tasks.

The tidyverse is a good convention to adopt: it is a collection of R packages which offer a unified grammar and design philosophy that makes it easier to learn one package after the next.

# Tabular data with `readr`

`readr` is useful to read (and write) rectangular data from (to) flat text files.

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Tabular data]

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(readr)
ejemplo_csv <- "

```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Syntax]

```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Functions]

.pull-left[
<br/>
Alternatively, you can use the `read.*` functions that are already loaded with the basic installation of R.

The most general of these functions is `read_delim()`, where you can specify the specific delimiter of the file.

Every `read_*` function has a sister `write_*` function to save data in different formats.
]

.pull-right[

<br/>

| Base R function | `readr` function | Delimiter |
|-----------------|------------------|:----:|
| `read.csv()`    | `read_csv()`     | `,`  |
| `read.csv2()`   | `read_csv2()`    | `;`  |
| `read.tsv()`    | `read_tsv()`     | `\t` |
| `read.delim()`  | `read_delim()`   | Any  |

]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Arguments]

You can have more control over the way the data is read by using the _arguments_ of the `readr` functions.

The most useful ones are:

- `delim`
- `col_names`
- `col_types`
- `skip`
- `n_max`

To read about them, type `?read_delim` in the R Console.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Troubleshooting]

When you import data with `readr`, the `problems()` function is useful to let you know if something went wrong and where.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(readr)
problem_csv <- "
Comuna,Defunciones,Fecha
Contulmo,1,2019-06-05
Calbuco,1,2020-01-16
Chillán Viejo,1,2021-08-16
Gorbea,2,2011-05-30
San Miguel,1,2012-02-11
Lumaco,1,2021-13-08
"
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
oops <- read_csv("path/to/problematic-file.csv")
#> Warning: 1 parsing failure.
#> row   col   expected     actual         file

Rectangular data means "tables", with a series of cells organised into rows and columns. Not all types of data are necessarily stored in this format.

The first tab of this slide shows what tabular data looks like when you open a file with a text editor like the windows notepad. On the right, we see how the same data looks in R when we import it using readr.

# Spreadsheets

`readxl` and `writexl` are two light-weight packages designed to read data into R.

.pull-left[
### [`readxl`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/)

- `read_excel()` to read spreadsheets of `xlsx` or `xls` files.
- `excel_sheets()` to list the spreadsheets in a file.

]

.pull-right[
### [`writexl`](https://docs.ropensci.org/writexl/)

- `write_xlsx()` to write tables to `xlsx` files.
- `xl_formula()` or `xl_hyperlink()`, to write special column types to a spreadsheet.

# SPSS, Stata and SAS with `haven`

.pull-left[

### [`haven`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/)

Enables R to read and write various data formats used by other statistical packages.


| Software | Read functions | Write functions |
|-|-|-|
| SAS  | `read_sas()`, `read_xpt()` | None |
| SPSS | `read_sav()`, `read_por()` | `write_sav()` |
| Stata | `read_dta()` |  `write_dta()` |

.pull-right[

### [`foreign`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreign/foreign.pdf) 

A commonly used alternative to `haven` is the `foreign` package. 

- Notably, it reads `dbf` files.

- Unfortunately, it doesn't read Stata files past version 12.

.panel[.panel-name[`r emoji("warning")` RData]

.pull-left[

You can save multiple R objects to a single RData file. 

When you load a new RData file into R, any R objects inside it will keep the names you originally assigned to them.

`load()` will silently overwrite objects with conflicting names. __This makes it dangerous__.

]

.pull-right[

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# load the uk_irl.RData, which can have 
# more than one object
load("gbr_irl.RData")

eu <- read_csv("eu.csv")

# saves 4 objects from the environment to 
# all_countries.RData
save(
  irl, gbr, eu, us,
  file = "all_countries.RData"
  )
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[`r emoji("white_check_mark")` RDS]


.pull-left[
You can only save one object at a time to an RDS file.

You can assign any new name to the object when you read it into R.

**01_clean-postcodes.R**

.footnote[

]

???

If you are going to be working mainly in R, you may want to save intermediary objects in a format that can be easily read (i.e. fast)
and interpreted by R. 

Unless you have a very good reason to do so, you should always favour RDS over RData files. The latter is dangerous because similarly named objects can be silently overwritten.

RData files are also harder to iterate over, exactly because you don't know the names of the objects that are being loaded into the environment. 

That is not to say that RData files are not useful. They can be extremely useful, for example, in Shiny apps, where it's often more efficient to have smaller objects.

The limitation of "one object per RDS" is less of an issue because of a special type of R structure known as a "list". We will speak more about these in a later session.

# Main `dplyr` verbs

The main functions, or _verbs_ from `dplyr` are:

- `rename()`, to rename columns.
- `select()`, to select columns.
- `filter()`, to select rows.
- `mutate()`, to create or modify columns.
- `summarise()`, to summarise information from columns.

The last three of these can be used with `group_by()` to do operations by groups of rows.

???
dplyr is a package focused on data manipulation. In R circles, more often people use the term "data wrangling".

dplyr functions are often referred to as "dplyr verbs". They are verbs because they perform an action on a table. 

All dplyr verbs take a table as input and return a table as output. In the next slides, we explore the syntax of each verb one by one.

.panel[.panel-name[Extension]

`rename_with()` is useful to rename many columns at once using a function.

```{r}
rename_with(air_pol, tolower)
```
]

]

???
rename() is used to change the column names in a table. 

Take a look at the syntax. Although it may seem a bit counter-intuitive, the new name is goes on the left-hand side of the equal (=) sign. This is for consistency with the mutate() function, that we will see in a little while.

rename_with() is an extension to rename() that allows to rename many columns at once by applying a function to the names of a table. In this example we use it to rename all columns, but know that it is a very flexible function that can implement more complex rules.

```{r}

.panel[.panel-name[Selection helpers]

`select()` is most useful when used with __selection helpers__, as documented in `?tidyselect::language`.

.pull-left[
```{r}
select(air_pol, REG_ID:TL)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
select(air_pol, REG_ID, 
       starts_with("T"))
```
]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Extension]

Columns can be renamed also during selection:

```{r}
select(air_pol, reg_id = REG_ID, year = TIME, pm2_5 = ObsValue)
```
]

]

???

select() is used to subset a table to keep only certain columns.

It is most often used with a special set of functions known as "selection helpers". These are useful when you want to select many columns based on their names, position, or some conditions.

Because it is such a common pattern, select() can be used to select and rename columns on the fly. 

Stata users: "select" is the equivalent of "keep"

# `filter()` __rows__

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Syntax]

`filter(<DATA>, <COND1>, <COND2>, ...)`
]

<br/>

- `filter()` returns a table with the rows where the condition returns `TRUE`

- Rows where the condition returns missing values (`NA`) are removed.

- The comma is equivalent to an AND (`&`) condition.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Logical comparisons]

| Condition | Reads |
|----------|-------|
| `x > y`  | `x` is greater than `y` |
| `x >= y` | `x` is greater or equal to `y` |
| `x == 3` | `x` is equal to 3 |
| `x %in% c(2, 8)` | `x` is either 2 or 8 |
| `x > y & x < z` | `x` is greater than `y` AND smaller than `z` |
| <code>x > y &#124; x < z</code> | `x` is greater than `y` OR smaller than `z` |

<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/a/17320389/14115463 -->

]

.panel[.panel-name[Examples]


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Keep only rows for France
filter(air_pol, REG_ID == "FRA")

# Get the region with the lowest level of air pollution
filter(air_pol, ObsValue == min(ObsValue))

# What was the level of PM2.5 in Colombia in 2000?
filter(air_pol, TIME == "2000" & REG_ID == "COL")
filter(air_pol, TIME == "2000", REG_ID == "COL") # mind the comma!
```

]
]

???

Like select(), filter() also allows us to subset a table. The key difference is that filter() acts on the rows, whereas select acts on the columns.

Whenever you see a "comma" inside filter() you should interpret is as an "AND" condition, not an "OR". If you want an "OR" you need to use a vertical bar.

Stata users: "filter" is the equivalent of "keep if"

When working with grouped data, it's important to keep an eye on those first two lines that are printed in the console.

For historical reasons, summarise() drops by default the last variable of the grouping. This behaviour can be changed with the .groups argument of summarise().

# Joining tables

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Functions]

__Mutating joins__, that add new variables to a table depending on the contents of another one.

- `left_join()`
- `right_join()`
- `full_join()`
- `inner_join()`

__Filtering joins__, that filter rows in a table depending on the contents of another one.

- `semi_join()`
- `anti_join()`

]

.panel[.panel-name[Syntax]

The syntax for all the join functions goes like:

```
<TYPE>_join(
  <LEFT_HAND_TABLE>, <RIGHT_HAND_TABLE>,
  by = c("<COMMON_VAR1>", "<COMMON_VAR2>", ...)
)
```

For the next examples, let's assume we have two tables:

.pull-left[
```{r x_join}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     3, "x3"
)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r y_join}
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     4, "y3"
)
```

]

]

.panel[.panel-name[`left_join()`]

.pull-left[
```{r, ref.label="x_join", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="y_join", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```
]

.left[
```{r}
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```
]

]

.panel[.panel-name[`inner_join()`]

.pull-left[
```{r, ref.label="x_join", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="y_join", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```

]

.left[
```{r}
inner_join(x, y, by = "key")
```
]

]

.panel[.panel-name[`anti_join()`]

.pull-left[
```{r, ref.label="x_join", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="y_join", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```

]
.left[
```{r}
anti_join(x, y, by = "key")
```
]

]

]

???

Joins are how we merge or combine relational tables in R. i.e. tables that share common IDs, or keys.

Left join is the most common mutating join. It preserves all the rows from the left-hand table, and adds new columns with information from the right-hand table.

Inner join is also a very useful join. It returns an intersection: only the rows from the left-hand table that have a match in the right-hand table.

Anti join is the most useful filtering join. It preserves all the rows from the left-hand table that do not have a match in the "right-hand" table.

# Binding tables

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[`r emoji("white_check_mark")` `bind_rows()`]

.pull-left[
```{r}
u <- tribble(
  ~num, ~val,
     1, "u1",
     2, "u2",
     3, "u3"
)

w <- tribble(
  ~num, ~val,
     1, "w1",
     2, "w2",
     4, "w3"
)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
bind_rows(u, w)
```
]


]

.panel[.panel-name[`r emoji("warning")` `bind_cols()`]


```{r}
bind_cols(u, w)
```

]

]

???

Binding rows is equivalent to what Stata users call "append". We take two tables and stack them on top of each other.

You should be careful with bind_cols(). There is barely ever a need for it. In general, what you would want in this case is an append.

# More on data manipulation

There are many useful `dplyr` functions that we did not cover today:

- `count()`
- `distinct()`
- `across()`

For some examples, see in their documentation or the vignettes. 

- Online: <https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/>
- In R: 
    - For the documentation of a function, see `?function_name` or `help("function_name")`
    - Use `vignette(package = "dplyr")` to see the available vignettes, and `vignette("name-of-the-vignette")` to navigate to a specific one.
