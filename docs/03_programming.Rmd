# Vectors

.pull-left[

__Vectors__ are the most common and basic data structure in R. 

There are two types:

- Atomic vectors
- Lists

There is a related object, `NULL` which represents the _absence_ of a vector.

]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/blob/master/diagrams/data-structures-overview.png?raw=true")
```
]

.footnote[
Ref: [Chapter 20, R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html#important-types-of-atomic-vector)
]

---
# Atomic vectors

.pull-left[

Atomic vectors are __homogeneous__, i.e. all their elements need to be of the same _type_.

```{r vect-types}
lgl <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)

int <- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L)

dbl <- c(5.5, 33.6, 8, 12.5)

chr <- c("coffee", "café")
```

We can create vectors using `c()` and assign them to an object using `<-`


]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/blob/master/diagrams/data-structures-overview.png?raw=true")
```
]

.footnote[
Ref: [Chapter 20, R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html#important-types-of-atomic-vector)
]


---
# Vector types

It can be difficult to tell the _type_ of a vector solely by the way it is printed in the console.

.pull-left[

When we print them in R:

```{r}
lgl

int

dbl

chr
```

]
.pull-right[

When we explore their type:

```{r}
typeof(lgl)

typeof(int)

typeof(dbl)

typeof(chr)
```

]

---
# Logical operations

.pull-left[

_From the first session:_

| Condition | Reads |
|----------|-------|
| `x > y`  | `x` is greater than `y` |
| `x >= y` | `x` is greater or equal to `y` |
| `x == 3` | `x` is equal to 3 |
| `x %in% c(2, 8)` | `x` is either 2 or 8 |
| `x > y & x < z` | `x` is greater than `y` AND smaller than `z` |
| <code>x > y &#124; x < z</code> | `x` is greater than `y` OR smaller than `z` |

]
.pull-right[

Logical operations return logical vectors

```{r}
telework_days <- c(2, 4:5)
office_days   <- c("monday", "wednesday")


4 %in% telework_days
3:5 %in% telework_days

is.character(office_days)
```


]

---
# Coercion

There are two ways to convert, or __coerce__, vectors from one type to another:

.pull-left[
### Explicit

```{r}
lgl
as.numeric(lgl)

int
as.character(int)
```


]
.pull-right[
### Implicit

```{r}
lgl
lgl * 5

dbl
chr
c(chr, dbl)
```

]

---
# Coercion

This concept is important to understand _warnings_:

```{r, error = TRUE}
ages_chr <- c("29", "88", "46", ">100")
ages_num <- as.numeric(ages_chr)

ages_num
```

`r emoji("warning")` __Avoid ignoring warnings__. Warnings, as opposed to errors, don't stop code execution, so mistakes can propagate.

---
# Missing values

Each type of atomic vector has it's own type of missing value

.pull-left[

```{r}
NA
NA_integer_
NA_real_
NA_character_
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r}
typeof(NA)
typeof(NA_integer_)
typeof(NA_real_)
typeof(NA_character_)
```

]

<br/>
Because of coercion this often doesn't matter.

.pull-left[
```{r}
c("tea", NA, "té")
```

]
.pull-right[
```{r}
typeof(c("tea", NA, "té"))
```

]

---
# Missing values are _contagious_

.pull-left[

Some functions have an option to remove them, but you need to be explicit about it.

```{r}
mean(c(10, 20, NA))
mean(c(10, 20, NA), na.rm = TRUE)
```

]

.pull-right[

Functions that remove them by default tend to give a warning:

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Ozone, Temp)) +
  geom_point()
```

]

---
# Missing values are _contagious_

`r emoji("warning")` You can't use `==` to identify the missing values in a vector. Use `is.na()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
x <- c(10, 20)

x == 10

x == NA

is.na(x)
```

]
.pull-right[
```{r}
y <- c(10, NA)

y == 10

y == NA

is.na(y)
```

]


---
# Recycling

Vectors of shorter length are __recycled__ to match the length of the longer vector

This makes fairly common operations quicker to type

```{r}
rates <- c(0.93, 0.85, 0.43)

rates * 100
rates * c(100, 100, 100)
```

---
# Recycling

Recycling can happen for vectors of any length, not just those of length 1

```{r}
c(10, 100, 1000, 10000) * c(1, 3)
c(10, 100, 1000, 10000) * c(1, 3, 1, 3)
```

And it also explains a fairly common warning:

```{r, error = TRUE}
1:5 + 1:3
```

---

# Subsetting

### By position

```{r, office}
office <- c("alexandre", "nikos", "maria paula", "tahsin")


office[2]

office[c(1, 4)]

office[-1]
```

---

# Subsetting

### With a logical vector

```{r}
office

present_on_monday <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
office[present_on_monday]
```

`r emoji("warning")` This is somewhere where we need to be aware of R's recycling rules

```{r}
office[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
```

---

# Subsetting

### By name

Vectors can be _named_ and we can use those names to subset them

```{r}
names(office) <- c("BANQUET", "PATIAS", "CALDAS", "MEDHI")
office

office[c("CALDAS", "PATIAS")]
```

# Conditions: warnings

`r emoji("warning")` `<CONDITION>` should evaluate to a logical vector of length 1. If it's a longer vector, only the first element will be used.

```{r}
dplyr::case_when(
  byear <= 1964        ~ "boomer",
  byear %in% 1965:1980 ~ "gen x",
  byear %in% 1981:1996 ~ "millenial",

# Loops

---
# For loops

.pull-left[
### Steps

1. Create an empty vector to store results

2. Specify the sequence to iterate over

3. Define what you want to do and where you want to store the result

4. (Optional) print the output

]
.pull-right[
### Structure

```{r}
output <- vector("double", 7)
for (m in seq_along(output)) {
  output[m] <- format(
    Sys.Date() + m, 
    "%e %b, %Y"
    )
}
output
```
]

---
# For loops
### Less-than-ideal patterns

- _Growing the output vector with each iteration_ is computationally inefficient. If you know the size that the output vector should be, use `vector()`.

- _Using colon notation and `length()` to define the sequence_ can lead to unexpected behaviour. What if `days` was a zero-length vector? What would `1:length(days)` return? What would `seq_along(days)` return?

```{r}
days   <- c("tomorrow", "day after tomorrow")
output <- NULL
for (m in 1:length(days)) {
  output <- c(output, format(Sys.Date() + m, "%e %b, %Y"))
}
output
```

.pull-left[
Unlike atomic vectors, lists can be __heterogeneous__. 

They can be made up of vectors of many different types, including other lists.

```{r}
a <- list(
  a = 1:3, 
  b = "a string", 
  c = pi, 
  d = list(-1, -5)
  )
```

]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}

```
]

.footnote[
Ref: [Chapter 20, R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html#important-types-of-atomic-vector)
]

???

Since they can contain other lists, lists are sometimes known as recursive vectors.

---
# Inspecting lists

Lists can be very big in size, so it's not always a good idea to print them to the console. 

To examine their structure, one useful way is to use `str()`

```{r}
str(a)
```

In the RStudio IDE, you can also use `View(a)`

---
# Subsetting lists

.pull-left[

Extract the component, returning a list:
  
```{r}
a["b"]
typeof(a["b"])
```
]
.pull-right[

Extract the component, removing a level of hierarchy:

```{r}
a[["b"]]
typeof(a[["b"]])

a$b
typeof(a$b)
```

1. __Arguments__: These can be empty or have default values.
1. __Body__: With the code that you want to execute according to the values taken by the arguments. At the end, the function should _return_ a value.
